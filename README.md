Running the DevOps Demo App Locally
The application is a React application, so you'll need to set up a development environment on your laptop. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Prerequisites:

1. Node.js and npm: React requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to run.Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.  npm is included with Node.js.Verify installation: Open a terminal or command prompt and run node -v and npm -v.  You should see version numbers
  
 2.Git: (Optional, but recommended) Git is a version control system.  While not strictly required to run the app, it's good practice to use it.Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/.Verify installation:  Run git --version in your terminal.
 
 Steps:Clone the repository:Open a terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (e.g., cd Documents).If you have Git installed, clone the repository:
 
 git clone <repository_url>

(Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of the repository containing the code.  If you copied the code from the previous response, you'll need to save it to a file first - see step 2)

If you don't have Git, you can download the code as a ZIP file (if available) and extract it to your desired directory.  If you copied the code from the previous response, proceed to step 

2.Save the code (if you copied it):.
If you copied the code from the previous response, you need to save it into a file
.Create a new directory (e.g., devops-demo-app)
.Inside that directory, create a new file named DevOpsDemoApp.jsx
.Paste the React code from the previous response into DevOpsDemoApp.jsx
.Create a new file named package.jsonAdd the following content
{
  "name": "devops-demo-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "framer-motion": "^11.0.6",
    "@tailwindcss/browser": "^4.0",
    "lucide-react": "^9.4.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "^5.0.1"
  }
}

3. Install dependencies:

.Open a terminal or command prompt
.Navigate to the project directory (the one containing DevOpsDemoApp.jsx and package.json) using the cd command
.Run the following command to install the necessary packages:  npm install
.Start the development server:In the same terminal, run the following command : npm start


This will start the React development server.  Your browser should automatically open and display the application.  If not, it will usually tell you the URL (often http://localhost:3000).

Explanation:

.npm install: This command reads the package.json file in the project directory and downloads all the listed dependencies (React, Tailwind CSS, etc.) into a node_modules directory

.npm start: This command starts the development server provided by react-scripts.  It compiles your React code, serves it in the browser, and watches for changes so it can automatically reload when you make updates

.Once the application is running in your browser, you can interact with it as described in the previous explanation.# Simple_Devops_Gemini
